Q1 - [One-dimensional Version]
Position 2 is a peak if and only if b ≥ a and b ≥ c. Position 9 is a peak if i ≥ h.
+ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9  
+ a b c d e f g h i  
Problem: Find a peak if it exists (Does it always exist?)
Tips: You just have to find the first peak, which means there is no need to find all peaks.
